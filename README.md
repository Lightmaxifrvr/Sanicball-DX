# Sanicball-DX

Welcome to the Sanicball-DX Repo! 
This Project is a continuation of Sanicball, the game by Badgersonn (https://github.com/BK-TN , viciousbadger@protonmail.com).
Currently it does nothing except be a (unfinished) port the game to a newer version of Unity.

This Project is mean to be opened with Unity6.(TBD.)

Also check out https://github.com/BK-TN/SanicballServerList, which lets you host a server list for the game.
